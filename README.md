In this analysis, the objective was to build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a loan being healthy or high-risk. The dataset contained financial information about loans, including variables such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and debt-to-income ratio.

Below are the accuracy, precision, and recall scores for the Logistic Regression model used in this analysis:
Logistic Regression Model:
   Accuracy: 0.9926
   Precision: 0.8447
   Recall: 0.9402

The Logistic Regression model showed strong performance in predicting loan statuses, with high accuracy, precision, and recall scores. Based on the results, this model is recommended for use, particularly because:
  Performance: The model performs well across both healthy and high-risk loan predictions, with balanced precision and recall scores.
  Problem-Specific Consideration: If the goal is to minimize financial risk, predicting high-risk loans accurately is crucial. The modelâ€™s high recall for predicting high-risk loans suggests it is effective in this regard.
Overall, the Logistic Regression model is a reliable choice for predicting loan status. However, depending on the specific needs and further tuning or exploring alternative models may be beneficial.
